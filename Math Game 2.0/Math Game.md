# Math Game.js

!!! tip Prompt

Create a math game using JavaScript where the user can test their math skills by answering a series of questions. 

The game will have a start button, a question element, an answer input, a submit button, and a result element. 

Once the user clicks on the start button, the game will begin and the user will be presented with a series of math questions. 

The user will enter their answer in the answer input and click on the submit button to check if their answer is correct. 

If the answer is correct, the user will receive a point and the next question will be presented. 

If the answer is incorrect, the correct answer will be displayed. The game will continue until all the questions have been answered or until the user runs out of time. The final score will be displayed at the end of the game.
